  <div class="item1">Why do I believe black people should swim more?</div>
  <div class="item2">I think black people should swim more because for one it's a good sport. You get a good work out in it and you might really enjoy yourself when competing against others.</div>
  <div class="item3">One main reason is because I swim myself. 
  It would be nice to have more people of my kind out there with me.</div>  
  <div class="item4">Stop spending much time on thinking about how you'll look after and worry about your self and what you like to do.</div>
  <div class="item5">In conclusion I would like for more black people younger or older to consider learning how to swim or if you already know how to swim to do it more often.</div>
