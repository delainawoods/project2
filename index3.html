<div class="grid-item item5">Ever since swimming has been a thing black people have always been the race that doesnt swim as much. Most of the reason is because they are scared, they dont want to messup their hair,
 or they simply just dont feel welcomed.They are scared because everyone has always told black people they are going to be the ones who fail at things first. Since swimming can techinically cause you to die from
 drowning they rather not take that chance. They dont want to take swim lessons because they think they are too cool and they dont want to teach themseves how to swim so they just dont. If we had more confidence 
 when it comes to sports it would be different because we wouldnt care how others feel about us always  failing.They dont want to mess up their hair because nowdays people get their hair done every two weeks, 
 people may not like the hair texture they have when its wet so they dont get in the water because they dont want to be embarassed. Also the part where I mentioned they dont feel welcomed is because white people 
 or some mexican people might stare at a black person for potentionally trying to swim which makes people uncomfortable.
